I am currently a Ph.D. student majoring in Industrial Engineering at Florida State University. I obtained my Bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering and a minor degree in Accounting both from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

I plan to graduate in Spring 2019, and I am actively looking for jobs related to data science and machine learning.
