I am currently a Ph.D. student majoring in Industrial Engineering at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/). I obtained my Bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering and a minor degree in Accounting both from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China.

I will graduate in Spring 2019, and I am actively looking for jobs related to data science and machine learning.
