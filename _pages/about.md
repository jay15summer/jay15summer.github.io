### Research
My research focuses on **developing data models and algorithms to improve the quality of manufacturing processes**, e.g., the spatial modeling of engine deck surface machining and assembly and the transfer learning for modeling of manufacturing processes with limited measurements. To this end, other than **engineering knowledge** on manufacturing, I am also studying **statistical modeling** and **machine learning**.

### Programming language
* Python
* R
* Matlab
